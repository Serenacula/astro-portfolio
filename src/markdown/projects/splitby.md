description: "A bash script for string manipulation."
---

A recent project, this was built out of a frustration with the native toolset for this particular task. The goal was a tool that could split strings by a delimiter, and then choose a selection of the result.

Built in native bash and perl currently, I will probably be rebuilding it in rust once I have the complete set of intended features built.
