description: "A bit-tune music generator. It builds a small score out of random notes, and then plays it for you with the browser's audio API."

This project was intended as a small test of my own understanding of how music works. It builds out a score of essentially random notes set into music patterns, and then plays it.

The audio and oscilloscope are handled by the web audio API, which is built into browsers.

There is a few interesting controls to modify the score it generates, and the outputted sound. It's a fun little thing to play with.

I recently rebuilt it in astro, since I found react was being a bit of a nuisance with some of the functionality I wanted.
